There are multiple pieces to setting up this cluster.

1. Installing packages using apt-get. (all machines)
2. Setting up hugepages (all machines) and rebooting the machines with the new boot parameters.
3. Installing dpdk. (all machines)

4. Setting up passwordless ssh (all machines)
5. Setting up NFS (different on different machines, must be per experiment)
6. Installing RAMCloud (nfs machine only)

The first three steps are expensive, but it should be possible to do them exactly once and snapshot the disk image.
Steps 4-6 should best be done by the setup script, and does not require a reboot.
